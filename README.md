# Census Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing U.S. Census data to uncover trends in education levels across genders and provide insights into equality. The analysis involves data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and generating actionable insights using Python.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw census data to make it analysis-ready.
- Explore trends in gender and education levels.
- Visualize findings to communicate data insights effectively.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing or incorrect data entries and standardized the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed gender distribution in different education levels.
   - Identified trends in education equality over time.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created bar charts and line plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Highlighted key insights visually for better understanding.

## Results
- **Insight 1**: Gender disparities in higher education levels were identified in specific age groups.
- **Insight 2**: Positive trends in education equality over recent years.
